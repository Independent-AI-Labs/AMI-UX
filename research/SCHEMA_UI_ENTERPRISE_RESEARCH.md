# Metadata-Driven UI Research & Enterprise Pattern Synthesis

## Objective
Establish an enterprise-ready strategy for auditable, testable, modular, on-demand UI generation driven by backend schemas. This memo surveys industry precedents, extracts repeatable patterns, and recommends architecture, governance, and tooling that align with AMI's requirements.

## Industry Examples & Takeaways
- **Salesforce Lightning / Lightning App Builder** – Entire CRM UI defined by metadata (objects, page layouts, component configs). Highlights: versioned metadata, granular permissions, declarative component registry. Critical pattern: metadata stored centrally and deployed through change sets with automated diff tooling.
- **ServiceNow Now Experience** – Uses JSON descriptors for forms and workspaces; supports audit-friendly update sets and scoped applications. Emphasises separation between data schema (tables) and experience schema (UI view definitions).
- **Microsoft Power Apps / Dataverse** – Model-driven apps generate forms/views from Dataverse schema; includes test harness (Power Apps Test Studio) and lifecycle management (solution packages). Demonstrates how to bind validation, automation, and analytics to metadata.
- **Backstage (Spotify)** – Software catalog and plugins defined through YAML descriptors, rendered dynamically. Shows extensible plugin registry and role-based visibility, with metadata versioning via Git.
- **Grafana Scenes & Dashboards** – JSON schema describing panels, data sources, interactions, supporting provisioning via Git and automated testing with Loki snapshots.
- **JSONForms / Eclipse Foundation** – React/Vue/Angular form generation from JSON Schema + UI schema. Offers renderer sets for enterprise components (Material, Carbon). Shows how to map schema keywords to component libraries cleanly.
- **Ant Design Pro / Formily** – Alibaba's schema-driven form engine with field lifecycles, effect hooks, remote data binding; demonstrates advanced dependency handling and validation pipelines.
- **Netflix Nimble / Metadata Driven UI** – Internal system where server returns layout metadata consumed by cross-platform clients; emphasises feature flagging and experimentation via metadata.

## Enterprise Requirements Derived
1. **Auditability**
   - Immutable history of schema changes (Git-backed registry + changelog service).
   - Schema versions tied to deployment artefacts; include signatures/checksums for compliance.
   - Runtime instrumentation: log which schema version rendered which experience per session.
   - Policy enforcement: linting rules ensuring sensitive fields have masking, actions have permissions, etc.

2. **Testability**
   - Deterministic schema snapshots (Python + TypeScript) committed alongside code.
   - Generated UI snapshot tests (Playwright/Cypress) keyed by schema version and view identifier.
   - Contract tests verifying backend schema exports match TypeScript runtime expectations (OpenAPI or JSON Schema validation).
   - Simulated data fixtures per schema allowing CI to render screens headlessly for visual diffing.

3. **Modularity**
   - Component registry mapping primitive types to React implementations with dependency injection (allows theme or host replacement).
   - Pluggable renderer bundles (e.g., base web, admin extensions, mobile-friendly) selected via capability flags in schema.
   - Namespaced schema segments by domain (auth, data streams, compliance) to avoid cross-team collisions.

4. **On-Demand / Runtime Fetching**
   - Schema delivery API with caching strategy (ETags, version headers) and offline fallback.
   - Lazy-loading of heavy renderer bundles conditioned on schema presence (e.g., load chart module when `visualization` primitive encountered).
   - Hydration hooks allowing schema updates without full page reload (subscription to schema invalidation events).

5. **Security & Governance**
   - Permission matrix embedded in schema (`x-ami.permissions`) referencing backend ACLs; UI hides disabled actions and logs unauthorized attempts.
   - Signed schema payloads for untrusted environments; clients verify signature before rendering to prevent tampering.
   - Secret-handling conventions (fields marked `sensitive=true`, UI enforces redaction/reveal timers and audit logging).

## Recommended Architectural Components
1. **Schema Registry Service**
   - Backed by `base/backend` Pydantic models exporting JSON Schema with `x-ami` extensions.
   - Provides REST endpoints: `GET /schema/{domain}/{version}` and `GET /schema/latest?domain=auth`.
   - Stores metadata (author, change summary, approvals) and ensures backward compatibility via semantic versioning.

2. **Schema Compiler & Type Generator**
   - Python pipeline to compile Pydantic models → JSON Schema → OpenAPI.
   - TypeScript generator (`openapi-typescript`, `json-schema-to-typescript`) producing strongly typed schema interfaces and renderer contracts.
   - CI step validating schemas (lint, compatibility diff) before merge.

3. **Renderer Runtime (React)**
   - Core library providing primitives: `Container`, `Collection`, `Input`, `ActionBar`, `Feedback`, `Visualization`.
   - Resolvers to map schema `type` and `x-ami.control` to actual components (e.g., `SchemaRenderer.register('input.secret', SecretField)`).
   - State management via context to handle form state, action dispatch, backend mutations.
   - Extension API for domain teams to register custom renderers without forking core runtime.

4. **Action Orchestrator**
   - Middleware that interprets schema-defined actions, invokes backend endpoints with typed payloads, supports optimistic updates, error routing to hint/toast systems.
   - Integrates with tracing (OpenTelemetry) for observability.

5. **Auditing & Telemetry Layer**
   - Every schema render logs: schema version, user, action executed, validation failures.
   - Configurable persistence (DataOps audit tables) for compliance review.
   - Optional replay capability: given schema version + event log, rehydrate UI state for investigation.

6. **Testing Harness**
   - Schema-driven fixture generator to produce realistic mock data for front-end tests.
   - Playwright test utilities that load schema snapshots and render them in isolation; golden screenshot comparisons stored per schema version.
   - Backend integration tests verifying endpoints accept schema-generated payloads.

## Research-Informed Patterns
- **Schema + UISchema Pairing** (JSONForms, Formily): separate domain schema (validation) from UI schema (layout, presentation). Use `x-ami.ui` namespace or parallel document to keep concerns modular.
- **Capability Flags & Feature Toggles** (Salesforce, Backstage): embed feature toggle hooks so experimental components can be rolled out gradually.
- **Change Management** (ServiceNow update sets, Salesforce change sets): treat schema changes as deployable artefacts requiring review/approval; integrate with existing AMI change control.
- **Component Certification**: maintain catalogue of approved renderers with accessibility certification, performance metrics, and security review (pattern used by Microsoft Fluent UI and Salesforce base components).
- **Observability Hooks** (Netflix metadata): ensure schema includes instrumentation config (event names, properties) enabling analytics without code edits.


## Meta-Platform Application
- **Beyond Low-Code**: Maintain declarative schemas as the canonical contract while permitting extensible behaviour graphs and sandboxed plugins so teams can orchestrate complex UX without locking into rigid builders.
- **Layered Descriptors**: Publish separate domain, experience, and behaviour layers that compose at runtime, allowing tenants or partners to override presentation without mutating validation logic.
- **Federated Distribution**: Allow external domains to publish signed schema packs; the registry verifies signatures and capability flags before exposing them to host applications.
- **Programmable Escape Hatches**: Support deterministic state machines, JSONLogic expressions, or WASM adapters referenced from schema metadata to deliver dynamic interactions within governed boundaries.
- **Observability by Design**: Embed analytics/event hooks directly into schemas so every meta-platform experience emits consistent telemetry across hosts.

## BPMN Integration
- **User Task Surfaces**: Map BPMN user-task input/output definitions to schema-driven forms; completing the form triggers ami-base task completion APIs automatically.
- **Process-driven Actions**: Link schema actions to BPMN signal/message identifiers, enabling drawers, toolbars, and dashboards to orchestrate processes without bespoke wiring.
- **Version Sync**: Record schema version + BPMN process version per interaction; leverage registry diffs to ensure UI updates track process evolution.
- **Compliance Alignment**: Feed schema render/audit events into the same compliance pipelines as BPMN execution logs, enabling end-to-end traceability for regulators.
- **Adaptive Workflows**: When BPMN branches or escalates, emit updated schemas or action sets so the UI adapts in real time while preserving audit trails.

## Action Plan for AMI
1. **Governance**
   - Create `Schema Council` (rep from backend, UX, compliance) to review schema additions.
   - Define naming/versioning conventions and compatibility guidelines (e.g., additive changes minor, breaking major).
   - Introduce schema lint rules (YAML/JSON) verifying presence of essential metadata (permissions, accessibility labels, analytics tags).

2. **Tooling**
   - Prototype schema exporter for current account providers; commit generated JSON to repo for transparency.
   - Build CLI (`ami-schema`) to fetch, diff, validate, and preview schemas locally.
   - Add docs: authoring guide, renderer library API, governance workflow.

3. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Phase 0: instrument existing provider forms to emit internal schema snapshots (for gap analysis).
   - Phase 1: deliver schema registry MVP + Add Account dialog rendered via runtime.
   - Phase 2: expand to drawer lists, toolbars, modals; integrate action orchestrator.
   - Phase 3: extend to dashboard/visualization surfaces and cross-application reuse.

4. **Testing & Auditing**
   - Add CI job generating schema diffs with automated compliance checks.
   - Implement Playwright scenarios for schema-driven forms with pipeline gating on visual diffs.
   - Feed audit logs into AMI Base security reporting for tamper detection.

5. **Performance & Caching**
   - Cache schemas client-side keyed by version; bust cache via HTTP cache headers or server-sent invalidation.
   - Lazy-load renderers (e.g., dynamic import chart libs) to keep initial bundle lean.
   - Pre-render critical schemas during build for offline-first experiences; fall back to runtime fetch for new schemas.
