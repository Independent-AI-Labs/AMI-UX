# Claude Development Workflow

This document outlines the established workflow for development tasks in this project.

## General Development Workflow

### 1. Task Planning and Analysis
- Use TodoWrite tool to break down complex tasks into specific, trackable items
- Analyze existing code structure before making changes
- Identify components, hooks, utilities, and data that can be extracted
- Plan the refactoring approach following React/Next.js best practices

### 2. Modular Refactoring Approach
When refactoring large files (like page.js):
- **Extract Components**: Create focused components with single responsibilities
  - Grid/layout components (`components/grid/`)
  - UI system components (`components/backdrop/`, `components/modal/`)
  - Feature-specific components (`components/drag/`)
- **Extract Hooks**: Move business logic into custom hooks (`hooks/`)
- **Extract Utilities**: Move pure functions to utility modules (`utils/`)
- **Extract Data**: Move constants and initial data to data modules (`data/`)

### 3. Directory Structure Standards
```
src/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backdrop/         # Backdrop rendering components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drag/            # Drag and drop system
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grid/            # Grid layout components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modal/           # Modal and overlay components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [existing]/      # Existing UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/               # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Pure utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                # Constants and initial data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [existing files]     # Core application files
```

### 4. Server Management
Use the improved scripts for development server control with full debugging:
- **Start server**: `node start-server.js`
  - Runs in background without blocking terminal
  - Creates PID file for process tracking
  - Logs output to `dev-server.log` and errors to `dev-server-error.log`
  - Provides clear status and debugging information
- **Stop server**: `node stop-server.js`
  - First attempts to kill using stored PID
  - Falls back to port-based killing (port 3000)
  - Shows recent server logs and errors for debugging
  - Cleans up all temporary files (PID, logs)
- **Emergency cleanup**: `npx kill-port 3000` (direct port kill)

### 5. Testing and Verification
Before committing changes:
1. **Build Test**: Run `npm run build` to ensure no syntax/import errors
2. **Server Management Test**: Test `node start-server.js` and `node stop-server.js` multiple times
3. **Runtime Test**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and verify functionality
4. **Chrome MCP Testing**: Use Chrome MCP tools to verify application loads and works correctly
5. **Log Verification**: Check `dev-server.log` and `dev-server-error.log` for any issues

### 6. Git Workflow
- Always stage all changes with `git add .`
- Remove any problematic files (like `nul`) before staging
- Use descriptive commit messages with emoji prefixes:
  ```
  üîß Refactor [component] into modular [description]
  ‚ú® Add [new feature]
  üêõ Fix [bug description]
  üìù Update documentation
  ```
- Document key metrics (e.g., "44% size reduction", "Build passes", "Runtime verified")
- NO CO-AUTHORED STUFF!!!

### 7. Best Practices Followed
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component/hook has one clear purpose
- **Component Composition**: Build complex UIs from simple, focused components
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract business logic from components
- **Clean Imports**: Use absolute imports and group logically
- **Prop Drilling Prevention**: Pass only necessary props
- **Performance**: Use useCallback/useMemo appropriately

## Key Tools and Commands

### Development Commands
- `npm run build` - Production build and verification
- `npm run dev` - Development server (use scripts for background operation)
- `node start-server.js` - Background dev server start
- `node stop-server.js` - Stop all processes on port 3000

### Git Commands
- `git status` - Check file changes
- `git add .` - Stage all changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with message
- `npx kill-port 3000` - Emergency port cleanup

# NEVER EVER EVER:

- PUT CO-AUTHORING BULLSHIT IN THE COMMIT MESSAGES
- SCREENSHOT ANYTHING IN THE BROWSER

# REMEMBER TO:

- GET CONTENT FROM THE BROWSER OFTEN TO VALIDATE YOUR WORK!!!
