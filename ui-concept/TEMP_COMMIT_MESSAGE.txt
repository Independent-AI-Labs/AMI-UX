🎨 Major UI Tile Animation System & State Management Overhaul

✨ **NEW FEATURES:**
- Complete animated UI tile system with smooth blur-in/out effects
- AnimatedUITile wrapper component for input/typing indicators  
- Comprehensive state machine with proper React hooks integration
- Generic tile system separating functional data tiles from UI tiles
- Error toast system with exponential blur animations

🔧 **FIXES:**
- Fixed stuck state requiring multiple ESC presses (bulletproof unlock)
- Fixed choppy blur animations (simplified to smooth 2-stage transitions)
- Fixed "u.unlock is not a function" runtime error with defensive programming
- Fixed input tile rendering and positioning issues
- Fixed duplicate React hook state notifications spam

🎬 **ANIMATIONS:**
- Pure blur-only animations (15px → 0px) with no laggy translations
- Input tiles: 0.5s enter, 0.4s exit with gentle easing
- Typing indicators: 0.3s enter, 0.2s exit for quick responsiveness  
- UI tiles: 0.4s enter, 0.3s exit with standard timing
- All animations use optimized cubic-bezier curves for 60fps performance

🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE:**
- Centralized state management with AppStateManager singleton
- useAppState, useConversationState, useContextMenuState hooks
- TileGrid system for managing both data and UI tiles
- Simplified ESC key handling with force-unlock capability
- Clean separation of concerns between state systems

🧹 **CLEANUP:**
- Removed all debug logging and coordinate spam
- Removed translation/movement from animations (pure blur only)
- Removed legacy state management references
- Consolidated unlock functions across all systems
- Simplified animation keyframes for better performance

🎯 **STATE TRANSITIONS:**
- workspace_free ↔ conversation_locked with proper validation
- Smooth input tile appearance/disappearance based on lock state
- Typing indicator animations with state-driven visibility
- Context menu integration with state management
- Error recovery with fallback mechanisms

🚀 **PERFORMANCE:**
- Bundle size optimized (16.5kB) with removed logging
- 60fps animations with minimal GPU load
- Faster animation durations for responsive feel
- Single ESC press guaranteed state reset
- Clean animation lifecycle management

This commit establishes the foundation for smooth, professional UI tile animations with rock-solid state management. All tiles now blur elegantly into existence without lag or unwanted movement.
