âœ¨ Enhanced UI with Parallax Effects & Dynamic Status Bar

ðŸŽ¬ **PARALLAX ZOOM EFFECTS:**
- Added sophisticated parallax hover animation to message tiles
- Hex container scales to 1.02x while content scales to 1.15x for depth effect
- Enhanced CSS specificity with !important to override LoD system interference
- Smooth transitions on hex-content, hex-avatar, and hex-message-actions elements
- Creates multi-layered zoom effect similar to modern UI frameworks

ðŸ“Š **DYNAMIC STATUS BAR:**
- Implemented smart collapsible status bar system
- Compact state: 40px height (clock only) for minimal space usage
- Expanded state: 75px height (clock + date) triggered by hover or active toast
- Smooth height transitions with cubic-bezier easing (0.3s duration)
- Date text slides in with fade animation when expanding
- Auto-collapse when toast disappears for clean UX

ðŸŽ¨ **VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Removed debug black box from interface
- Restored X button positioning (moved controls to top-24 to clear status bar)
- Enhanced status bar with backdrop blur and improved transparency
- Darkened date text color from #6a6a6a to #3a3a3a for better visibility
- Updated date format to compact "FRI, AUG 1" style without year
- Error toasts now positioned in status bar center area with proper z-index

ðŸ”§ **STATUS BAR FEATURES:**
- Responsive design: 35px/67px heights on mobile devices
- Mouse interaction: Hover to temporarily expand, auto-collapse on leave
- Toast integration: Stays expanded while error messages are visible
- Proper state management with useEffect hooks for reliable expand/collapse
- Glass effect with backdrop-filter blur and gradient fade-in

âš¡ **PERFORMANCE & UX:**
- Smooth CSS transitions for all state changes
- Efficient hover detection with proper event handling
- Clean separation between temporary (hover) and persistent (toast) expansion
- Maintains visual hierarchy with proper z-index stacking
- Space-efficient design that maximizes content area

This update transforms the interface with sophisticated animations and intelligent space management, creating a more engaging and professional user experience.
